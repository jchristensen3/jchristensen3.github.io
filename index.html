    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Born on (June 5th, 1982) I have lived in Omaha, NE my entire life, and besides some crazy winters I love it<br>here. I graduated from Plattsmouth High School and then attended Bellevue University to study Psychology.<br>I managed to get my foot in the door at Union pacific starting out as a contractor building our company PC’s.<br> I loved it, changed my degree to Information Technology and got my Associates degree from Metro Community College.<br> I have now been with Union Pacific for 10 years in my current position as an Associate Project Engineer. My current roll at<br>UP is working with any and every technical issue that someone can encounter. I would really like to become an<br>expert in a single area of technology which is why I applied for the Code for Good program. I enjoy helping and<br>working with people and would love the ability to make things easier for them to use. I have been<br>married for 6 Years to my husband Chad and we have two beautiful children Kayli is 5 and Cohen is 3.</h3>
